# Microsoft-Malware-Prediction
Python scripts for Microsoft Malware Prediction contest

These four Python scripts are used to do the Microsoft Malware Prediction contest.

You can down load the dataset here https://www.kaggle.com/c/microsoft-malware-prediction and put it into the same fold with those scripts to run.

We trained the Random Forest, XGBoost and SVM model to this contest.

Our best model is the Random Forest model with Cross Validation, and we reached the AUC of 0.67 on Kaggle.
